## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-mithril-webpack from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-mithril-webpack
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo mithril-webpack
```

### Mithril WebPack Generator Features

This generator will provide the following features to your new application. Optional features are marked accordingly and the user will be prompted to decide if they would like to include them.

#### WebPack

WebPack is the included bundling package for this generator. WebPack will bundle all required files as well as pre-proccess files from SASS to CSS. WebPack is very extensible and too learn more please visit [the WebPack website](https://webpack.github.io/).

##### Code Splitting

WebPack allows us to automatically split our code into bundles for increased initial load speed. The code generated by this generator already takes advantage of this so that each and every module is split into its respective bundle.

##### Lazy/Pre Loading

This generator includes code that will start to load your additional modules after the first module render, this means the end user only needs to wait to load the first module, additional module are loaded while the user is browsing the first module.

#### SASS

This generator comes packed with a SASS pre-processor. SASS brings many powerful features to CSS which you can read about [on the SASS website](http://sass-lang.com/)

#### Bootstrap [OPTIONAL]

You have the choice to include Bootstrap in your application when you first generate the folder structure. Your application will include Bootstrap SASS which will let you pick and choose the features you wish to use in your web application.

#### jQuery [OPTIONAL]

You also have the choice to include jQuery into your project. jQuery is required for Bootstrap and will be installed if you select to include Bootstrap into your application.

#### Git [OPTIONAL]

Users will be prompted if they would like the generator to initialize a Git repo for their project. If they choose yes, their project will be initialized with a Git repo and an initial commit already made.
